# Cancer Dataset Analysis Using PCA and K-Means Clustering

## 1. Introduction

This analysis aims to distinguish benign from malignant tumors using PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering to group patients.


## 2. Data Preprocessing

- Data was cleaned by removing missing values and the `id` column.
- The `diagnosis` column was converted to a factor for classification.
- Features were standardized using `scale()` for PCA.


## 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was applied, and the first two components (PC1, PC2) explained most of the variance. A scree plot confirmed the adequacy of these components for visualization.


## 4. K-Means Clustering

- The Elbow Method identified `k=2` as the optimal number of clusters.
- K-Means clustering was applied with `k=2`, and results were visualized in the PCA space.
- A contingency table showed that clustering roughly aligned with benign and malignant diagnoses but included some misclassifications.


## 5. Conclusion

PCA reduced the datasetâ€™s dimensionality effectively, and K-Means clustering provided a basic separation of benign and malignant tumors. Further work could optimize clustering or apply supervised learning for better accuracy.
