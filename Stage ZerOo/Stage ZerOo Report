I created a data frame in R to store information about my team members. This table includes their names, Slack usernames, email addresses, hobbies, countries, areas of expertise, and preferred programming languages. Each row represents a different team member, and each column holds a specific type of information. After creating the table, I displayed it so that I could see all the team details in one place. This helps keep the information organized and easy to use.
